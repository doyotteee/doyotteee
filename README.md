## Hi there 👋

👋 Hi, I'm Doyotteee!

I'm a passionate software developer with a strong interest in building impactful and scalable solutions. My journey in programming started with curiosity and has grown into a deep commitment to continuous learning and sharing knowledge with the community.

🌱 Currently, I’m exploring new technologies in web development, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence. I enjoy collaborating on open-source projects and believe in the power of teamwork and open knowledge.

💡 I love solving problems, whether it’s through clean code, creative design, or innovative thinking. My main tech stack includes JavaScript, Python, and Node.js, but I’m always eager to learn new languages and frameworks.

🚀 Some highlights:
- Contributor to several open-source projects
- Experience in building RESTful APIs and modern web applications
- Enthusiastic about automation, DevOps, and CI/CD pipelines
- Active in tech communities and enjoy mentoring fellow developers
